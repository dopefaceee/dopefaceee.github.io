InIKino is a multiplatform Dart app for browsing movies and showtimes for Finnkino cinemas.

InKino showcases Redux, has an extensive set of automated tests and 40% code sharing between Flutter and web. The Android & iOS apps are made with a single Flutter codebase. The progressive web app is made with AngularDart. This project is generally something that I believe is a good example of a multiplatform Dart project.
