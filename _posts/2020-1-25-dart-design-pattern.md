## 1. Singleton

Singleton is a creational design pattern which ensures that a class has only one instance and also provides a global point of access to it.

## 2. Adapter

Adapter is a structural design pattern, also known as wrapper. It is one of the most common and most useful design patterns available to us as software developers.

## 3. Template Method

The Template method is a fundamental technique for code reuse.

## 4. Composite

The Composite is one of the structural design patterns. Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## 5. Strategy

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## 6. State

Allow an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

## 7. Facade

Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## 8. Interpreter

Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an inter­preter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

## 9. Iterator

Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially
without exposing its underlying representation.

## 10. Factory

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to sub­classes.

## 11. Abstract Factory

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes.

## 12. Command

Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable opera­tions.

## 13. Memento

Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object’s internal
state so that the object can be restored to this state later.

## 14. Prototype

Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object’s internal
state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
